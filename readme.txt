The program mainly models physics of collisions of moving balls within a physical system.
Classes and their visual representation is written in PhysicsAndGraphicsRemake module.
Calculations that regard common geometry and procedures, that would be supernatural in real life (like 'operate_anomalies'), are described withing the GeneralProcedures module.
The TestApp module is the main launching file that exploits the other two. It has a simple-looking canon and a closed system meant to contain balls, that are shot by the canon.

The physics here is solid, though it doesn't maintain rotating movement of circular shapes and force of friction. However, the code is expendable and those important features can be included too. Maybe in future I will do it, despite it was not my initial goal. 

In general the mechanics here is all apt for use in making a descent arcanoid or something like Yeti sport games.
